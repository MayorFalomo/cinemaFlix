## Lessons Learned

getting the series to play trailer was a challenging but i am still working on playing the movie trailers.

The carousel library i used for the centergrid isn't as responsive i'd like, never using that particular library again.

At the point of building this project i have never done "Adding a watchlist"but doing this taught me how to add an object to a a new array in another component using state, i used the same principle i used in my notes app to achieve this.
